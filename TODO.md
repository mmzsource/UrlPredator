URL-PREDATOR
============

## Minimal Features

All implemented

## TODO's for current feature



## Nice to have

- configparser shouldn't care about the arg order. args in config currently assume the path args are provided last.
- Set (config) and report timeout for GET calls
- Show the urls as a tree so it's easy to see which url lead to which other url (parent, child field?)
- Detection of circular references
